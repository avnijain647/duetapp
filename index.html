 <b>Duet is a digital artwork about finding space for reflection, expression and connection in our daily lives, an intimate experience between strangers.</b>

<div style="padding-top:40px;">Duet is a collaboration between <a href="https://invisibleflock.com/" target="_blank">INVISIBLE FLOCK (UK)</a> and <a href="http://quicksand.co.in/" target="_blank">QUICKSAND (India)</a>.</div>

    Duet is an app that pairs participating individuals and invites them to exchange details of their lives by answering a question a day, building new anonymous space and connections. Prompted by Duet, a participant gradually builds a picture of their partner and their surroundings through anonymous shared messages, while also finding a moment for reflection in their own lives and surroundings.

   <div class="section">
Duet - Chapter 2, will run for 100 days and seeks to provide an intimate and reflective space through which we can all directly respond to this new world we find ourselves in, especially in light of COVID 19.

Duet is a work that seeks to challenge the ways in which we interact online. Duet is not social media, it is also not a game. Instead it operates in a different space - a slow, dreamy experiential space where you are invited to share small glimpses of life with someone new.

Duet was first presented in 2017. In its first edition, the app was live for 368 days and connected over 1200 participants in India and in the UK, generating a 25000+ database of beautiful and eclectic answers. Each daily question was different and participants took part in varying ways, some connecting with a single partner for the entire year and some dipping in and out of the experience.

    <div class="press"><b>Press & Participant Quotes</b></div>
  <div class="press">
   <div class="pressbox">
<div class="quotes">Personal, local and global, carefully crafted and decidedly fascinating. <p style="font-weight:700;">- Mary Halton, New Scientist</p></div>

<div  class="quotes">Taking conversations beyond the superficial to find what you share in common with a fellow human in a different country. <p style="font-weight:700;">- Meghana Choukkar, Deccan Herald</p></div>


<div  class="quotes">The questions force you to stop whatever you are doing and think back on your day or observe your surroundings more keenly. Your own answers sometimes tend to surprise you. Answers from across the oceans definitely surprise you and present just enough of a picture for you to then lend your own shape and colour to whatever brief glimpse you have received of another life in another culture. <p style="font-weight:700;">- The Big Issue North</p></div>

<div  class="quotes">Duet slows down your life and thoughts, and gives you a break from the drill of mindlessly ‘liking’ and ‘commenting’ <p style="font-weight:700;">- Barkha Kumari, Bangalore Mirror</p></div>

<div  class="quotes">My partner and I connected on some of the most loneliest nights and glorious days. It was great to have her with me. Not seeing her or knowing her name did not matter at all. There were days, when I would look forward to her update, to know what was happening to her and this connection means a lot to me now. <p style="font-weight:700;">- Participant</p></div>
